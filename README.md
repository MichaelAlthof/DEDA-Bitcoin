# DEDA-Bitcoin

The workflow of this folder is as follows: 

1. open run_simulation.R which will then load all the necessary files and settings.
2. the analysis is done with the evalution.R file which again loads all necessary functions and settings. It outputs tables of results which contain the number of clusters users are assigned to.
